# geoshrink
GeoShrink is a lightweight tool for fast conversion of GeoTIFF raster files to JPEG format, with optional resizing to reduce resolution or file size. Designed for geospatial workflows where sharing or previewing large imagery (e.g. from UAV, satellite, or remote sensing) requires more compact formats.
